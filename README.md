# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
Objective:
X Education is an education company that specializes in selling online courses to professionals within various industries. Every day, numerous professionals visit their website to explore the available courses. The company promotes its courses through various websites and search engines like Google. Once these visitors arrive on the website, they may browse courses, fill out course-related forms, or watch instructional videos.
When visitors complete a form and provide their contact information, such as an email address or phone number, they are classified as "leads." Additionally, the company also acquires leads through past referrals. Subsequently, the sales team engages with these leads by making calls, sending emails, and more, in an effort to convert them into paying customers. However, the lead conversion rate at X Education is currently at about 30%, indicating that most leads do not end up converting.
To enhance the efficiency of their lead conversion process, the company aims to identify the most promising leads, also referred to as "Hot Leads." By focusing more on communicating with these potential leads, rather than contacting everyone, the lead conversion rate is expected to increase.
To achieve this goal, the company plans to build a logistic regression model that assigns a lead score between 0 and 100 to each individual lead. This lead score will enable the company to target potential leads more effectively. A higher score will indicate that the lead is "hot," meaning they are highly likely to convert. On the other hand, a lower score will suggest that the lead is "cold" and less likely to be converted.
The logistic regression model should be designed to be adaptable to potential changes in the company's requirements in the future. The model must be capable of addressing additional challenges presented by the company, which are detailed in a separate document. This information should be included in the final presentation (PPT) alongside the recommendations derived from the logistic regression model.
